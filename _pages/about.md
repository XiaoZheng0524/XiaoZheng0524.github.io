Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), where I am part of the LAMP (Learning and Machine Perception) Laboratory. My research focuses on Artificial Intelligence, with a particular emphasis on 3D Reconstruction.  I am deeply engaged in exploring cutting-edge techniques to reconstruct three-dimensional models from two-dimensional images or other data sources, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Research Interests
======
- **3D Reconstruction**: Developing novel methods to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D models from 2D images.
- **Neural Rendering**: Leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for photorealistic rendering and scene representation.
- **3D Gaussian Splatting**: Investigating efficient and scalable techniques for 3D scene representation and rendering.

Research Interests
====
- **Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence**, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), 2023 - Present
- **B.Sc. in Electronic Information Engineering**,  University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), 2019 - 2023
